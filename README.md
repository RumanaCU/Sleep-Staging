# Sleep-Staging
Automatic sleep stage classification based on single channel EEG using compressed/distributed DL model to use in an edge device with limited resources

**Database to use:** Sleep-EDF expanded database, (if possible) MASS.

**Technology to use:**  Convolutional neural network(for source model development), 
                        Deep Transfer Learning (for finetune to target domain)

**Platforms:** MATLAB (for data preparation), Python3, TensorFlow 2 for network training and evaluation, NumPy, SciPy, sklearn, h5py, etc.
